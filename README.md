# üó≥Ô∏è Thesis Website ‚Äì Secure Digital Voting System

A full-stack digital election system designed for school-wide use, featuring QR code registration, fingerprint-secured voting, real-time results tracking, and an admin dashboard with advanced control features.

---

## üîç Overview  
This project is a **secure digital voting kiosk system** developed for academic elections. The software powers both public-facing features (like candidate info and live voting updates) and an admin dashboard with sensitive backend controls.

The actual voting interface was deployed **exclusively on the physical kiosk**, which integrates **QR code registration** and **fingerprint verification** for authentication.

I was **solely responsible** for the entire software stack ‚Äî including frontend, backend, and database architecture.
